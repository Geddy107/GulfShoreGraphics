# Project Step 1

## Idea #1
### Messaging Platform
- Create a Messaging application similar to that of Textra, but with more dynamic features almost a cross between a Facebook feed, Groupme (in regards to modifying the chat post creation) and normal SMS.
- include feature that will allow users to message memes and gif that are linked to user inputted emotional responses.
- allow for useful features such as scheduled texts, contact pinning, group naming, and conversation customization.
## Idea #2
### Encyclopedia/Database for Vintage Tools
- Be able to accurately date vintage hand planes (to start) via roll marks, pat dates, ect. and other  desirable vintage tools.
- eventually allow for user input almost like the Wikipedia.
- create a database for images of roll marks and tools to allow users a visual guide for dating their own tools,
similar to http://www.vintagemachinery.org/, but ultimatly provides a more enjoyable user experience.

## Idea #3
### Online Store for a Digital Music Channel "Sugarshack Sessions"
- Create an online shop that provides a more streamlined and enjoyable user experience.
- Allow users to navigate away from the site and retain items in their cart.
- Allow products to be displayed in real time with quantity on hand.
- Allow users to submit reviews on products.
- Allow sharing of products via social media.
- Allow for Paypal access (in the future).
