# Project Part 2
Choose one project from your preliminary research which you will pursue to completion by the end of the second term. From the point of view of a customer who has hired you to build this project, describe the need/purpose, intended users, and high-level features of the project in plain language (3-5 paragraphs minimum).

Your customer need statement should be included in your project source repository, preferably in a "docs/" subdirectory under the top level.

    * I have decided to go with creating the online web shop that gives my client a web-based marketplace so that they may reach out to a broader market.

    * Since my client is in the vinyl decal business, I want to deliver a product that will allow them to interact with their clients with the following methods.


We are requesting website/shop that will allow us to reach out to customers that are outside of our general scope. we want the website to be interactive and user friendly and allow customers to feel confident that when they visit our site for their vinyl needs, they will have a hassle-free experience that will make them want to recommend others to the site. a large majority of our revenue is from custom decals and vehicle services so we want to emphasize these products and services on our page. ultimately, we want a dynamic, hassle-free page that allows us to reach out to a broader market. A list can be found below of our requests.



- Allow customers to send and upload custom images with a description of the dimensions and quantity of the decal that they want custom made. while also ensuring to save the customers contact information should there be any questions about the product. 

- List services that are available and how much the services cost (such as vehicle wraps, business decals for vehicles ect.)

- Allow customers to see decals/prices that are currently in-stock and can be shipped or picked up immediately (salt life stickers and products that are always on hand.) 

- Allow for users to have a shopping cart that can be saved should the customer leave the page.

- A gallery of finished products.

- Video that plays (no sound) on the home page that provides a brief overview of the company and shows the company at work.

- Calculate shipping for products. 

- Main tabs will include: Home, Products, Services, Gallery, About 

- Do not allow for the storing of credit card information. 

- Have a dynamic user interface to keep client stimulated. 

- Avoid saving customers personal data that could potentially lead to the client being held responsible for data breach.
