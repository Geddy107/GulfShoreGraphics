- List services that are available and how much the services cost
 (such as vehicle wraps, business decals for vehicles ect.)

- A gallery of finished products.

- Allow customers to see decals/prices that are currently in-stock and can be shipped or picked up immediately (salt life stickers and products that are always on hand.) 

- Do not allow for the storing of credit card information. 

- Avoid saving customers personal data that could potentially lead to the client being held responsible for data breach.

## FULL_________________________________________________________
- Have a dynamic user interface to keep client stimulated. 

- Allow customers to send and upload custom images with a description of the dimensions and quantity of the decal that they want custom made. while also ensuring to save the customers contact information should there be any questions about the product.

- Video that plays (no sound) on the home page that provides a brief overview of the company and shows the company at work.
